Personalized Financial Recommender

Atplotlib is a hybrid financial recommendation system built in Python and Streamlit. It combines content-based filtering, collaborative filtering (SVD), and risk-adjusted recommendations to provide personalized asset suggestions for users based on transaction history, asset features, and risk profiles.

ðŸš€ Features

Synthetic Data Generation: Simulate users, assets, and transaction history.

Content-Based Filtering: Compute user profiles using asset features like sector, volatility, and past returns.

Collaborative Filtering (SVD): Predict ratings for user-asset pairs using SVD.

Hybrid Recommendations: Combine CF and content-based scores for better personalization.

Risk Alignment: Adjust recommendations based on user risk tolerance and asset volatility.

Interactive Streamlit Demo: Explore recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

âš¡ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hthakral14/Recommenderfinancial.git
cd Recommenderfinancial


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ–¥ Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py


Select a User ID from the dropdown.

Click Get Recommendations.

View top asset recommendations with asset ID, ticker, sector, and score.

ðŸ”§ How It Works

Data Generation: Generates synthetic datasets for users, assets, and transactions.

Feature Engineering: One-hot encodes categorical features (sector, market_cap) and standardizes numeric features (volatility, past_return).

Content-Based Filtering: Builds user profiles weighted by past transactions and calculates cosine similarity with assets.

Collaborative Filtering: Trains an SVD model on user-asset ratings to predict missing ratings.

Hybrid Recommendations: Combines normalized CF and content-based scores using a weight alpha=0.6.

Risk Alignment: Adjusts scores based on user risk tolerance vs asset volatility.

Recommendation Output: Returns top-K recommended assets for a user with scores.
